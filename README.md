# DTMF

**[DTMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling)** stands for **Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency** Signaling, designed for communication between telephones and telecommunications centers. In DTMF, for each of the 12 keys on the phone, a special signal is sent so the receiver determines which key is pressed. For each key, a combination of two sine signals is sent, whose frequency is given in the table below.

so I use Python to simulate DTMF.
